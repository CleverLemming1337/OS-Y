# OS Y
This is a small self-built operating system using an EFI kernel in C.

## Try it

- Run `./0A_complete_build.sh`
- Copy the content of EFI_IMG on a USB device.
- Now you can boot OS Y. 

> [!TIP]
> You may need to disable secure boot.

> [!NOTE]
> Screen output is currently not supported for OpenCore (Mac devices) although keyboard input is working.
